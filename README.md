# 404 Page Not Found

> An inspiration gallery for those boring 404 pages.

## The problem

*"404 Not Found"* pages are, most of the time, overlooked by backlogs.
But we know the truth! The truth is that you will face one of them sometime of your life and when facing a nice and friendly 404 page makes all the difference to the user experience (UX).

## Motivation
[Angular](https://docs.angularjs.org/404), [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/404), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/404), [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/404), [webcomponents](http://webcomponents.org/404), [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/404), [MDL](http://www.getmdl.io/404), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/404)...
All of them create lots of **great** lines of code, but neither one create a good 404 page.

If you're still not convinced, check out these amazing examples:
